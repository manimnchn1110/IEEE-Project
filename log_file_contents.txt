PDF Example:

"GET /ielx7/8919/7934110/07828082.pdf?tp=&arnumber=7828082&isnumber=7934110 HTTP/1.1"

ielx7 - Partition for the document.  All start with "ielx" with a number from 1 to 7 following.
8919 - Unique publication number.
7934110 - Unique issue number.
07828082.pdf - Unique article Number

The PDF can be in a frame and this would be the "referrer":

"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828082" 

You can only count examples with ".pdf" since someone can get a PDF with out a frame you don't want to double count.  So it is intersting to look at the frame URL but you can't use it to count PDF downloads.

For Member Abuse:
Member id = granting id This must be the case when examining member abuse.

Mapping:

String[] parts = str.split(" (?=(([^\"]*[\"]){2})*[^\"]*$)");
host = parts[0]; //This is the host that served the request.  It will always be ieeexplore.ieee.org
client_ip = parts[1]; //This is the outward facing IP of the requesting browser.  This can be the IP of their machine, proxy server, etc.
place_holder = parts[2]; //No longer used
seq_id = parts[3]; //This is either the member id, institutional id, or the combination of both.  This field isn't very useful.
full_request_date_1 = parts[4]; //The date and time of the request
full_request_date_2 = parts[5]; //The time zone from GM of the request
clf_request = parts[6]; //The URL requested.

institution_id = parts[14]; //The institutional id of the user.
member_id = parts[15]; //The memeber id of the user.
granting_id = parts[16]; //The id that granted access to the protected resource.  This has to be either the member id or the institutional id.
unica_id = parts[17]; //Unique id for the user.  This is not reliable for users coming from the same IP.
duration = parts[18]; //How long the user stayed on the page.

sdr2 = parts[23]; //Use to track users within corporations.  Not many customers have this utility. SAML
sdr3 = parts[24]; //Use to track users within corporations.  Not many customers have this utility. SAML
roaming_ip = parts[25]; //User can register their device at an institution to use when they are away.  This last for 30 days.  The IP that they are using for roaming goes here.
finger_print = parts[26]; //A unique id stored in a permanent cookie to uniquely identify a device.  This is 100% reliable.  Cookies are pinned to browser so a user can have multiple browsers on a device and it will look like 3 devices.
